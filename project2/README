### TODO

- train on AWS
- build model without pooling layer, as quoted by cs231n *"Discarding pooling layers has also been found to be important in training good generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs). It seems likely that future architectures will feature very few to no pooling layers."*
